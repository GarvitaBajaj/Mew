# Mew
Mew is an open-source Mobile Crowdsensing framework aimed at facilitating MCS application development. Mew is currently available for Android platform (API 16 and above) and implemented as a distributed platform with two components - a server and an Android library. The server component is developed as an Eclipse project (Java v. 1.8) and offers a plug-n-play environment to developers to implement new task allocation algorithms as per their requirements.

The instructions to deploy Mew are available at https://www.evernote.com/shard/s307/sh/07533b01-ff64-4696-98cf-afe9cc6627b3/1805cbe9ebbb50724d7bfc2f6ef89a01
