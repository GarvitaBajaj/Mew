# Mew
Mew is a distributed, open-source framework that aims to facilitate development of Mobile Crowdsensing applications. The client component is developed as an Android library (support API 16 and above) and the server component is developed as an Eclipse project (Java v.1.8). The server component offers a GUI and allows users to plug-in new task allocation algorithms for collecting sensor data from a subset of mobile devices.
